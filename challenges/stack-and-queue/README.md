# Implement a Stack and a Queue Data Structure
Write a function with classes and methods that allow one to implement a Stack and Queue Data Structure. 

## Challenge
Create Node, Stack, and Queue classes that can be manipulated through push, pop, peek, enqueue, and dequeue methods. Write tests for all methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
First I created a Node class w/ properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node. Next, I created a Stack class w/ a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated. Finally, I created a Queue class w/ a front property that creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
