# First In, First Out Animal Shelter
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Challenge
Write a class called AnimalShelter which operates using a first-in, first-out approach by using an enqueue() and dequeue() method. Enqueue adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object. Dequeue returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Approach & Efficiency
First I set up a class called AnimalShelter with 2 queues, this.dogs and this.cats. I then referenced the stack-and-queues challenge for the enqueue and dequque methods.
