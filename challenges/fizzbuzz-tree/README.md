# Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a Tree
Write a function with classes and methods that allow one to implement a Stack and Queue Data Structure. 

## Challenge
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value.

## Approach & Efficiency
First I created a function called fizzbuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument. Next, I determined if the value of each node was divisible by 3, 5 or both, and changed the value of each of the nodes to “Fizz”, “Buzz” or “FizzBuzz”.
