# Linked Lists
Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure.

## Challenge
Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure.

## Approach & Efficiency
I created a Node class with properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node. Next I defined a method called includes that takes a value argument and adds a new node w/ that value to the head of the list. Then I defined a method that took any value and returned a boolean result dependent on whether it existed as a Node's value within the list. Finally I defined a method called toString that takes no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.
