# Implement a Tree
Write a function with classes and methods that allow one to implement a Stack and Queue Data Structure. 

## Challenge
Create a Node and Binary Tree class.

## Approach & Efficiency
First I created a Node class w/ properties for the value stored in the left and right child nodes. Next, I created a Binary Tree class w/ methods for each of the depth first traversals, preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, in appropriate order.
